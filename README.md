# pseudo-lang
Pseudocode based programming language to make coding easier.

## Goals
The aim of this project is to create a programming language that works like pseudocode. The user will write out their code in human-readable, written english language format. Our application will then execute the user's intended program. 

### Example #01

##### Code
`write a for loop that prints out numbers one through ten`

#### Output
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

### Example #02

##### Code
`write a for loop that prints out numbers one through ten using a space delimeter`

#### Output
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

## Features
This project will include an IDE mobile application that will exectue the program, similar to replit. There will be a scorllable text input area for users to type in their code. Similar to many popular IDEs, the language will highlight key words in specific colors. 
Additionally, there will be a seperate, closable window to display the output. Users can toggle the code and output windows off and on depending on their preference.

## Architecture
Front End:
  - Shell Screen: the closable window where the user can type in their pseudocode
  - Console Screen: the closable output window where the user is able to see their executed code
  - Run Button: on press, activates interpretation and execution of the code written in the shell
  - Sign up (popup, multifactor authentication) and Login screen for different users
  - Projects sidebar:
      - Open project, Create project, remove project options.
    
Back End:
  - Keyword Identifier Module: identifies the keywords that the user types in, such as "delimeter" or "for loop"
  - Change Keyword Color Module: highlights the keywords in specific colors when the keyword is typed and identified 
  - Interpreter Module: interprets the pseudocode
      - Lexer: turns the sequence of characters in the pseudocode into a sequence of tokens
      - Parser: takes the sequence of tokens and produces an abstract syntax tree 
      - Evaulator: interprets the abstract syntax tree
  - Execute Function: executes the user's interpreted pseudocode and displays output in the Console Screen
